## 1. About the Project
Py-Champ is a (briefly describe genre: e.g., arcade / puzzle / platform / strategy) game where players (goal‚Äîe.g., ‚Äúguide the snake to collect tokens while avoiding obstacles‚Äù).  
It was designed to be:
- Lightweight and fast-loading
- Easy to fork and extend
- Educational (showcasing Python-to-web, or if pure JS, update accordingly)

> Replace this description with your game‚Äôs real narrative and core objective.

---

## 2. Live Demo
The game is deployed via GitHub Pages:  
https://cruze-tech.github.io/Py-Champ/

If the page doesn‚Äôt load:
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for blocked scripts
- Verify JavaScript is enabled

## 10. Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
If pure static JS:
- Any modern browser

If using Node (for tooling):
```
node >= 18
npm >= 9
```

If Python (for build or PyScript experiments):
```
python >= 3.10
```

### Clone
```
git clone https://github.com/cruze-tech/Py-Champ.git
cd Py-Champ
```

### Install (optional, if dependencies exist)
```
npm install
```

### Run Locally
If purely static:
- Open `index.html` directly OR
- Serve for cleaner module loading:
```
# Simple Python server
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```
Visit: http://localhost:8000

### Build (if bundling)
```
npm run build
```

---

## 11. Running Tests (If Implemented)
```
npm test
```
or
```
pytest
```
Describe coverage thresholds or snapshot tests if used.

---

## 12. Architecture & Design Notes
- Rendering Loop: (requestAnimationFrame / interval)
- Separation of concerns:
  - Game state vs rendering
  - Input handling module
  - Collision detection logic
- Extensibility: Add new entities by extending `BaseEntity`
- Performance hooks: Object pooling for sprites (if applicable)

Add diagrams if useful (e.g., state machine, update cycle):
```
Input ‚Üí Update State ‚Üí Detect Collisions ‚Üí Apply Effects ‚Üí Render Frame
```

---

## 13. Data & State Management
- Central `gameState` object (lives, score, level, flags)
- Persistence: localStorage key `pychamp_highscore`
- Serialization: JSON export (planned / implemented)

---

## 14. Performance Considerations
- Minimized reflows
- Batched rendering
- Asset preloading
- Avoided large GC churn (pooled arrays for particles)

Add Lighthouse / FPS benchmarks if available.

---

## 15. Accessibility
Planned / Implemented:
- Keyboard-only navigation
- High-contrast mode toggle
- Reduced motion mode
- ARIA labels for menus

---

## 16. Deployment (GitHub Pages)
Deployed from branch: `gh-pages` (or `main` if using root)

Typical workflow:
1. Build (if needed)
2. Commit compiled assets
3. Push to branch
4. GitHub Pages settings: Source = (branch)/(root or /docs)

If using an action:
Add example workflow file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (not shown here; can be added later).

---

## 17. Roadmap
- [ ] Sound effects & music toggle
- [ ] Mobile-friendly on-screen controls
- [ ] Difficulty selector
- [ ] Online leaderboard (server / Supabase / Firebase)
- [ ] Skins / Themes
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Pause menu enhancements

---

## 18. Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-improvement
   ```
3. Commit changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing improvement"
   ```
4. Push:
   ```
   git push origin feature/amazing-improvement
   ```
5. Open a Pull Request with a clear description & screenshots if UI-related

Coding Style:
- Follow ESLint rules (if configured)
- Prefer pure functions for logic modules
- Keep functions under N lines where possible

Commit Convention (suggested):
- feat:, fix:, chore:, refactor:, docs:, test:, perf:

---

## 19. Troubleshooting
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Blank screen | JS error | Check DevTools console |
| Assets 404 | Wrong path | Verify relative paths |
| Controls lag | Multiple loops running | Ensure only one game loop instance |
| Highscore not saved | localStorage blocked | Check browser privacy settings |

---

## 20. FAQ
Q: Does it work offline?  
A: (Add answer‚Äîconsider a service worker for offline support.)

Q: Can I add my own levels?  
A: Yes‚Äîadd JSON to `src/levels/` and register it in `levelIndex.js`.

Q: Will there be mobile support?  
A: Planned (see Roadmap).
